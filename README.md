# Big Sofa Angular Technical Test

## Demo

Here's a [demo of how the app works](https://gfycat.com/FittingLimpJunco).


## Setup

To install and run the app you'll need node and npm.

To install dependencies and start the local webpack server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the app.


## Help

I've added some local JSON files from the github API, the github API only allows for 60 requests an hour.

No need to make this overly complex, just to give you a ballpark figure I ended up with roughly:

* 26 lines of HTML
* 59 lines of CSS
* 18 lines of JS

If you run into trouble don't be afraid to ask for help, Good luck! :)
