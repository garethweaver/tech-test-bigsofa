# Big Sofa Angular Technical Test

This Angular 1.0 app fetches JSON from the a Github API using the angular resource service. It displays a list of the last 5 open issues on the bootstrap repository along with the avatars of the github users who opened them.

Required languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Angular 1.0

**Please download the repo rather than forking it.**


## Demo

Here's a [demo of how the app works](https://gfycat.com/FittingLimpJunco).


## Setup

To install and run the app you'll need node and npm.

To install dependencies and start the local webpack server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the app.


## Help

I've added some local JSON files from the github API, the github API only allows for 60 requests an hour.

No need to make this overly complex, just to give you a ballpark figure I ended up with roughly:

* 26 lines of HTML
* 59 lines of CSS
* 18 lines of JS

If you run into trouble don't be afraid to ask for help, Good luck! :)
